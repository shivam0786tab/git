V.imp

git checkout <commit> -- * or git checkout <commit> -- index.html

to come back

git checkout main -- *

V. imp -> suppose we made changes in some imp files (they were incorrect by misktake , not yet staged) - to restore back to the prev working version -> git restore <file> or git restore .

Now suppsoe we added somw incorrect changes and we did git add that file , now 

to revert back it from staged to unstaged -> git restore --staged <file>
then , to make it back to prev version -> git restore <file>

Now , suppose if we added some good changes in our stagig area , it will definitely show in the staging area , now after suppose we did some changes in the same file
and do git status -> it will show the same file in modifies and to be added 

so 

git restore --worktree index.html

suppose s, we commited the wrong changes and we want to revert back then 

git reset --hard HEAD^ -> it will move back to the prev commit

now , to see last some commits with file diffs
